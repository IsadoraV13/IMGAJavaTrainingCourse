package BasicConcepts2.Recursion1;

//Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the array. We'll use the
//convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call
//can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.
//
//        Array11([1, 2, 11], 0) → 1
//        Array11([11, 11], 0) → 2
//        Array11([1, 2, 3, 4], 0) → 0

public class Array11 {
