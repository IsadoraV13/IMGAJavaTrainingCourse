//The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition.
//The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of
//the previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. Define a recursive fibonacci(n)
//method that returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.
//
//        Fibonacci(0) → 0
//        Fibonacci(1) → 1
//        Fibonacci(2) → 1

public class Fibonacci {
//    public int Fibonacci(int n) {
//    }
