//Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of the two groups is the
//same, with these constraints: all the values that are multiple of 5 must be in one group, and all the values that
//are a multiple of 3 (and not a multiple of 5) must be in the other. (No loops needed.)
