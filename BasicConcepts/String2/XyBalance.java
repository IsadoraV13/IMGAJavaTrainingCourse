//We'll say that a String is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' chars in the string, there exists a 'y' char somewhere later
//in the string. So "xxy" is balanced, but "xyx" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's. Return true if the given
//string is xy-balanced.
//
//        XyBalance("aaxbby") → true
//        XyBalance("aaxbb") → false
//        XyBalance("yaaxbb") → false
