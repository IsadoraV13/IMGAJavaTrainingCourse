// Given 2 non-negative ints, a and b, return their sum, so long as the sum has the same number of digits as a.
// If the sum has more digits than a, just return a without b. (Note: one way to compute the number of digits
// of a non-negative int n is to convert it to a string with String.valueOf(n) and then check the length of
// the string.)

//        SumLimit(2, 3) → 5
//        SumLimit(8, 3) → 8
//        SumLimit(8, 1) → 9
