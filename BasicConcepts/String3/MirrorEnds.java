//Given a string, look for a mirror image (backwards) string at both the beginning and end of the given string.
//In other words, zero or more characters at the very begining of the given string, and at the very end of the
//string in reverse order (possibly overlapping). For example, the string "abXYZba" has the mirror end "ab".
//
//        MirrorEnds("abXYZba") → "ab"
//        MirrorEnds("abca") → "a"
//        MirrorEnds("aba") → "aba"
