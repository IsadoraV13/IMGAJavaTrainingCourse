//Given a string, return a string where every appearance of the lowercase word "is" has been replaced with "is not".
//The word "is" should not be immediately preceeded or followed by a letter -- so for example the "is" in "this" does
//not count. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is a letter.)
//
//        NotReplace("is test") → "is not test"
//        NotReplace("is-is") → "is not-is not"
//        NotReplace("This is right") → "This is not right"
