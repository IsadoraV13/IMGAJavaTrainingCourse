//Given a string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -- so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" count,
//but not the 'y' in "yellow" (not case sensitive). We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an
//alphabetic letter immediately following it. (Note: Character.isLetter(char) tests if a char is an alphabetic letter.)
