//Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have
//been removed (not case sensitive). You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only
//non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" leaves "x".

//        WithoutString("Hello there", "llo") → "He there"
//        WithoutString("Hello there", "e") → "Hllo thr"
//        WithoutString("Hello there", "x") → "Hello there"
